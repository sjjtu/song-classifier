### Project for SF2935 

This is the repository for the course project in SF2935 "Modern Methods of Statistical Machine Learning" taken in the fall semester 2022/23 at KTH. During the lecture we investigated the most common statistical learning methods for classification, e. g. linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, neural networks etc. The goal of the project is to train a classification model that classifies whether a given song will be liked or disliked by the lecturer.
